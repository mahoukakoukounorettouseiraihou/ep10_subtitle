00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,070
FEBRUARY 18, 2096

2
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,200
Lina...

3
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,290
Tatsuya...

4
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,240
Did you hear?

5
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,580
Yeah.

6
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,120
I'm not going to be your friend.

7
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,620
I know. We live
in different worlds, after all.

8
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,450
Tatsuya, please wait.

9
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:46,080
I can see a parasite aura 30 degrees
to the right of the direction you're moving.

10
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,580
I see them, too!

11
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,620
Three of them. Two men, one woman.

12
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:59,620
A girl in a mask is approaching the parasites
from the opposite direction!

13
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,160
I came to Japan as one
of the strongest magicians in the world.

14
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,910
But my one-on-one with Miyuki
ended in my defeat.

15
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,290
And then, I suffered...

16
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,790
a total defeat to Tatsuya.

17
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,410
But at least...

18
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,950
At least, I'll carry out the role of Sirius...

19
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,370
the Stars commander!

20
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,410
Leave this to me!

21
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,910
Mikihiko!

22
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,120
Roger!

23
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,910
Let's see.

24
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,990
That makes one!

25
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,240
One got away! Mizuki...

26
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,290
Can you see it?

27
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:12,790
I'm sorry, but I can't make out
individual movements from here.

28
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,990
Oh. Sorry, that's okay. Don't worry about it.

29
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,410
Angie Sirius!

30
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,700
What?

31
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,160
Could you not kill them
before we finish sealing them?

32
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,240
The cleanup is going to be a pain.

33
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,490
Nothing to do with me.
I just need to deal with the deserters.

34
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,620
Sirius's mission?

35
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,290
What I mean is, I want you to do that
after we seal the parasites' main bodies.

36
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,700
One of them already got away.

37
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,580
That isn't part of my mission.

38
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:53,240
I only need to complete my mission
and do the Sirius's duty.

39
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,790
That was Lina, right?

40
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,080
She looks like a completely different person.

41
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,830
Why would you think it was her?

42
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,620
Her gestures, I guess.

43
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,160
The way she moves her arms, legs and head...
And you can tell a lot from the eyes.

44
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,120
I'm impressed.

45
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,700
I'm sure you know this,
but this is a secret, too.

46
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,990
Okay.

47
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:15,370
And I'd like to say
the same thing I said to her to you.

48
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,990
Not to kill them?

49
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:22,990
Exactly. As long as the host body doesn't die,
the parasite can't get out of it.

50
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,950
Nonlethally disabling them
is more certain to do the trick.

51
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:30,160
Sorry. I just can't do that, Tatsuya.

52
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,740
I've been prepared
for my opponent to kill me

53
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,450
ever since I decided
I'd kill others with my sword.

54
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:39,830
So, when I think about me being killed...

55
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,580
Well, I can't leave them alive on purpose
and draw out their pain.

56
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,160
Well, I can't argue with that.

57
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,290
I guess I'll just have
to put in more work, then.

58
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,370
You're late!

59
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,370
Shut up! We're doing the best we can--

60
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,370
Brother...

61
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,830
They are...

62
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,990
the Batto-tai.

63
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:14,240
A commando infantry platoon
belonging to the JGDF's First Division

64
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,240
and comprised solely of magicians
specializing in hand-to-hand combat.

65
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,200
But why would this platoon that's under the
Kudou Family's influence be mobilized tonight?

66
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,580
Panzer!

67
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,370
We'll take these guys!

68
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,490
Yeah. You and Miyuki
can go on ahead, Tatsuya.

69
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,870
Okay. I'll leave it to you, then.

70
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,120
Let's go, Miyuki.

71
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,700
Right, Brother.

72
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,200
All righty.

73
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,950
Let's take these guys out fast.
Then, we'll catch up with them.

74
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,080
Right. This shouldn't take long.

75
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,290
Brother...

76
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,490
What happened here?

77
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,490
Lina, get back!

78
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,540
Nobody asked you!

79
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,290
Parasites can literally use magic
just by thinking it.

80
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,790
Lina's greatest weapon
is her spell activation speed.

81
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:32,330
But even with her overwhelming speed,
up against six parasites,

82
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:36,660
both of us are forced
to prioritize defense. So...

83
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,660
Miyuki!

84
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,330
Yes, Brother!

85
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:12,910
You saved me there.

86
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,330
You're welcome.

87
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,200
Erika, Leo, be careful!

88
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,160
The parasite's main body is over there!

89
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,540
Doton?

90
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,830
Schild!

91
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,120
Leo, that's a parasite!

92
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,450
Oh, crap!

93
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,450
Pixie!

94
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,410
Pixie, get over here.

95
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,240
At once, sir.

96
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,450
Honoka, you back up Pixie.

97
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,830
Right!

98
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,990
Erika, Leo, stay where you are.

99
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,240
Tell the others there, too.

100
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,660
Huh? Okay.

101
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,080
Right.

102
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,620
I agreed without skipping a beat...

103
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,790
but I have no idea
what "backing up" means here.

104
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,370
I have to get a good read
on her situation first.

105
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,080
VISITOR ARC X

106
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,160
Found it.

107
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,330
Found it.

108
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,240
Return to us!

109
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,080
I'm not part of you!

110
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,200
I...

111
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,540
belong to him!

112
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,330
Then, take this!

113
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,740
What is that?

114
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,240
There's a giant power
pressing down on that doll.

115
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,700
Tatsuya, what on earth is that?

116
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,080
The result of you not listening
to what my brother told you.

117
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,330
You went around killing every parasite
host body in sight without a second thought.

118
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,330
Now they're free and on a rampage.

119
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:01,950
Lina, how do you plan on making amends
for this mismanagement?

120
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,950
What do you mean "mismanagement"?

121
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,490
I was just carrying out my mission!

122
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,080
Then, the least you could do
is clean up after yourself.

123
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,410
Can you do that?

124
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:18,290
Even my brother had to take
a passive method by sealing them.

125
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,910
Just watch! I'll do it!

126
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,670
Wait, Lina!

127
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:23,200
Shut up! You be quiet, Tatsuya!

128
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,330
I need to finish
this mission successfully!

129
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,990
If I don't...

130
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:33,740
then what am I even doing here?

131
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,870
Then, a lightning attack!

132
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,330
It's not working!

133
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,450
How about compressed air bullets?

134
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,910
Ultrasonic waves!

135
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,830
Gravity shock wave!

136
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,450
It's coming, Lina!

137
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,290
Brother...

138
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,290
Miyuki may have the sense of touch
to detect spirit information bodies,

139
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,290
but not the sense of vision
to get a bird's-eye view.

140
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,040
Because of that, the area of interference
is necessarily slipping out of position.

141
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,080
It's extremely taxing to think
about holding out in a situation

142
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,490
you don't know how long
you'll have to hold out for. At this rate...

143
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:41,240
the two might give in.

144
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,160
Physical attacks are out of the question.

145
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,330
If we have any chance,
it's magic that affects the mind.

146
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,990
It's the only way left.

147
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,290
Mikihiko, can you see
what's happening here?

148
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:59,370
Yeah. I'm in the middle of really
quickly making a sealing circle...

149
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,290
so wait just a little longer.

150
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,910
How likely is it that the sealing circle
will suppress all this?

151
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:09,660
To be honest,
probably less than fifty-fifty.

152
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,870
Mikihiko, it only needs to be for a moment.

153
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,330
Please just suppress it for ten seconds.

154
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,700
All right.

155
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,330
I'll suppress that thing for ten seconds
no matter what it takes!

156
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,370
Tatsuya, I'll help, too!

157
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,660
Great.

158
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,990
Mikihiko, start the countdown!

159
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,080
Okay!

160
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,120
Three!

161
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,330
Two!

162
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,830
One!

163
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,330
Now!

164
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,370
Miyuki...

165
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,330
Look.

166
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,580
This is...

167
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,830
the world that my brother sees.

168
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,990
I can see it, Brother.

169
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,950
There.

170
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,660
Cocytus.

171
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,490
Lunar magic?

172
00:16:54,330 --> 00:17:00,330
Even though I couldn't see the parasite,
I sensed its destruction.

173
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:04,660
Such powerful lunar magic...

174
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,540
Miyuki, look.

175
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,290
You and Tatsuya both... What are you?

176
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,740
Lina...

177
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,540
Tell nobody what you saw just now.

178
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,950
Wh-What the hell?

179
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:28,410
In exchange, I swear to keep quiet
about your identity as Angie Sirius.

180
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:35,410
This applies to not only Miyuki and me,
but to everyone on our end involved in this.

181
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:44,330
Fine. If you'll stay quiet,
I'll keep you and Miyuki a secret, too.

182
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,990
Nobody would believe me anyway, I bet.

183
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,240
I see.

184
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,950
Lina...

185
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,240
Something else?

186
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,370
If you ever want to quit being a soldier,

187
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,450
I think I can help.

188
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,740
I have acquaintances who can help.

189
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,160
Wait, Tatsuya!
Why would you ask me that?

190
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,700
I don't want to stop being the Sirius!

191
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,950
I see.

192
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:32,200
Sorry, that was a weird thing to ask.

193
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:48,370
Your Excellency Kudou,
I consider it a great honor to meet you.

194
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,660
My name is Ayako Kuroba.

195
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:02,910
I am a member of the Yotsuba's lowest ranks,
charged with serving our family head, Maya.

196
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,580
A representative of Lady Yotsuba?

197
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,830
No wonder you're so levelheaded
despite your age.

198
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:14,410
Incidentally, Your Excellency,
we don't have very much time to spare,

199
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:18,330
so there is one thing
I would like to ask you about.

200
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,740
Go ahead.

201
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,200
Thank you.

202
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,080
With all due respect,
I am given to understand

203
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,160
that Your Excellency's intent is to bring back
these sealed monsters called "parasites."

204
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,990
But to tell you the truth,

205
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:37,580
the errand I have been sent on by my family
head is to also collect the sealed parasites.

206
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,990
Is it?

207
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:45,040
Fortunately, there are
two sealed vessels here.

208
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,740
Shall we each take one...

209
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,990
Your Excellency?

210
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,080
Very well.

211
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,580
We'll take the friendly approach
and share the spoils evenly.

212
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,200
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.

213
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,830
Thanks to you, Tatsuya,

214
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:14,160
I'll be able to finish this mission safely.

215
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,620
Brother...

216
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:24,950
About Lina... Do you think
she'll take what you said to heart?

217
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:28,120
I'm sure Lina has
her own things to deal with.

218
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:34,410
She's certainly not the only one
who can't get herself to the place she wants.

219
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:39,580
But you still offered to help her anyway...

220
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,160
Why?

221
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,910
What do you mean?

222
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:47,870
Brother, why do you try to help Lina?

223
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:53,540
Do you have special feelings for her?

224
00:20:53,540 --> 00:21:00,830
I just thought leaving the Stars
would be more convenient for the future.

225
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,080
Not just leaving the military, either.

226
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,620
The best option would be to have her
become a naturalized Japanese citizen here.

227
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,740
But that doesn't mean
I don't sympathize with her.

228
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:13,700
In a way, we're a lot alike.

229
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:19,080
Or maybe I should say we belong
to the same category of person.

230
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:26,040
Neither one of us had any real choice
in where we ended up today.

231
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,370
You could call me enrolling at First High
a choice I forced them to let me have,

232
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:36,200
but I don't think Lina even had
a little choice like that.

233
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:42,330
I was never given a choice, but one day,
I'll make one and choose for myself.

234
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:50,290
I figured I'd offer help out of friendship
if Lina wanted the same thing, but...

235
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,990
I guess it was none of my business.

236
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,450
That isn't true.

237
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:08,330
I'm sure that one day...

238
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:18,410
No, in the near future,
your consideration will reach her heart.

239
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:25,740
Because this incident must've made
Lina doubt her current self.

240
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:30,160
She may be a little simple,
but she's smart.

241
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,660
Miyuki...

242
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,410
"Simple"? That's pretty mean.

243
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:52,080
